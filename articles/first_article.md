#Hello, World!

I always wanted to improve my use of Markdown, to muscle memory level performance, as it is one of the first things outsiders see when visiting your repo. But alas, it's not something you write in every day so my skillset is of yet a bit lacking. So when I want things to look nice I find myself repeatedly [using other resources](https://stackedit.io/) mid flow.

Further, some apps I have coming down in my pipeline will require a bit of publishing and copy writing on my part, and right now I'm evaluating tools that I want to use. Currently the frontrunner is the rich text editor from [basecamp called 'trix'](https://github.com/basecamp/trix).

However, in going through the entries in the rails rumble which I happily [participated in last weekend](http://schwaughlin.ngrok.io) with some colleagues, I saw this interesting publishing tool. So I'm going to give it a go, and if I like it maybe integrate it into one of these apps! Maybe it'll provide support if I want to write markdown flavored emails too... Hmmm... What do you guys think of it?

```ruby
def schwad
  puts "Schwad likes to explore new tools for his apps!"
end
```

The above is manually checking out code. Below will be attempting to add snippets of code!

## One really gnarly method I had to write during RailsRumble!
